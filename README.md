# Integrated species distribution model (mixing conflict and camera trapping data)

Right now the associated scripts on this repo will simulate and analyze presence-only data with detection / non-detection data from planned surveys. Models to estimate the set parameter values from the simulated data are written in `JAGS`. 

After cloning the repository all you will need to open up is the `simulate_poisson_process.R` script and run through it. The integrated model does take some time to run.
