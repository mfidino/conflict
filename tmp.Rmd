The table below is metadata for all of the parameter estimates in the coyote, opossum, and raccoon models.

		# po_mu
		"The presence-only intercept for the nuisance wildlife data. Given the mean-centered covariates, this essentially represents the relative proportion (on average) of conflict data to camera trap data across the landscape. As the nuisance wildlife complaint data was more abundant than the camera trap data these are all very high. Do not interpret this as 'conflict' being high. The spatial variation in conflict (i.e., the slope terms) are more important.",

		"The slope terms from the presence-only conflict model. The three elements are respectively the response to URB2, income, and vacancy.",
		# po_season
		"The random effect term for variation in conflict among sampling periods. There is one for each sampling period.",
		# po_sd_season
